# churn-predict
Here is the Telco Customer Churn problem. After performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and preprocessing, I created a model. You can find all the details here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13Xfe61aPp2V6otf8NEBGqHh9SBJpiY2w?usp=sharing . I deployed the model on Streamlit Cloud, and you can access it here https://churn-predict-sm36f4vfbukmifrqxbjkdw.streamlit.app/.

Also, I deployed it using FastAPI (you can find it in the 'deployedUsingFastAPI' branch), where you can test it by running the code and making a POST request using Postman

and here where i got the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data
